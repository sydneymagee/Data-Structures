Program 1 
CS 3460

My program determines whether or not the graph is connected, bipartite, a tree,
and if it is cyclic or not.

In order to run my program, please write "java Program1" along with the file name
that you wish to run.
After that, the program will prompt you to key in a root value.
Then the program will output some information.
