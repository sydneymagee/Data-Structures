This is my Final Programming Assignment for CS 3460.
The program uses what we have learned throughout
the semester to try to find the shortest routes 
that two traveling salespeople would take across the
country. After lots of testing I found that using Depth
First Search and setting the starting point to 0 and 
(numCities -1) produced efficient and similar answers.  

To use my program in terminal:
type "java Final fileName"
Final is the name of the Class.
fileName is the test file of your choice.
Go On Tour!

Thank you for a wonderful semester! :)
