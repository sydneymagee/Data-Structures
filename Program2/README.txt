This is my Program 2.
@author Sydney Magee
@version 11.24.2020

This program finds the minimum spanning tree.

This program is run by typing: "java MST" on a terminal machine.
Then the program prompts the user for a file name (EX. graph1.dat).

The program will read the number of verticies and edges and 
output the disjoint sets and list of edges.
